# Template for VS code editor using QtWidget framework(Version: 6.9+)

This small program is a template for working on Qt6 projects with Visual Studio Code IDE.

## Setup your own project

This project is just a template, you can reuse it in your own project. You'll need to:

- copy the .vscode directory
- copy or create the `CMakePresets.json` file
- copy or create the `CMakeUserPresets.json` file, however, do not commit it to your git repo, add it to .gitignore.
- copy the qt6.natvis file, if using the `MSVC` compiler
